Code From CU CS classes

Current Collection of Coding assignments that I have used for my Computer Science Classes at CU Boulder.

Bell_Box: The assignment was to code a program that finds the smallest rectangle that bounds a set of points.

Bell_DynamicPandaPeril: "In the two-player game “Pandas Peril”, an even number of cards are laid out in a row,
face up. On each card, is written a positive integer. Players take turns removing a
card from either end of the row and placing the card in their pile. The player whose
cards add up to the highest number wins the game." The assignment was to then code a dynamic approach to the game that does no worse then the greedy approach. 

Bell_PathCount: The assignment was to code a program that calculates the number of paths along a spider web.
